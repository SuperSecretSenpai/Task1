# Task1
Ok the task is up!
Go ahead and either clone the repository or just download it as a zip
This actually is not a programming task believe it or not :)))))
once you have the files downloaded, you will need to search throught the directory for the task instructions
**If you two kouhais didnt find eachother its ok if you do the task alone, OR ask a JSA member to help you out :)))))

There are two methods to completing operation find the task description:
1. Brute Force look through every directory and file 
OR
2. Use google and the command line to figure out how to seach through to contents of a bunch of files in filders
